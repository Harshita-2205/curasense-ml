## Preliminary Diagnoses

### 1. Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with Acute Hyperglycemia
*   **Reasoning:** The patient, a 42-year-old male with a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes, presents with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia, blurred vision, and fatigue) that have developed over the past 2 weeks. Laboratory values confirm severe hyperglycemia with a Random Blood Sugar of 350 mg/dl and an HbA1c of 10.5%, indicating persistently poor glycemic control over the preceding months. The initiation of intravenous fluids, insulin infusion, and electrolyte replacement confirms an acute hyperglycemic state requiring urgent medical intervention.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   Continue close monitoring of blood glucose levels, fluid balance, and electrolytes as currently managed.
    *   Once stabilized, conduct a thorough review of the patient's current diabetes medication regimen, adherence, and lifestyle factors.
    *   Provide comprehensive diabetes education focusing on self-management, including dietary adjustments, regular physical activity, and proper medication use.
    *   Referral to an endocrinologist for long-term optimization of diabetes management to achieve and maintain target glycemic control.

### 2. Diabetic Retinopathy
*   **Reasoning:** The patient's long-standing history of type 2 diabetes (10 years) significantly increases his risk for microvascular complications. The reported symptom of blurred vision, combined with specific findings on fundoscopic examination (microaneurysms and cotton wool spots), are pathognomonic for diabetic retinopathy. These findings are characteristic of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, a common and potentially vision-threatening complication of uncontrolled diabetes. The elevated blood pressure also contributes to the risk and progression of retinopathy.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   Immediate referral to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive dilated fundoscopic examination to assess the severity and stage of diabetic retinopathy, and to rule out other ocular complications such as macular edema.
    *   Emphasize the critical importance of achieving strict glycemic control and blood pressure control to slow the progression of retinopathy and preserve vision.
    *   Regular follow-up with ophthalmology as recommended by the specialist, potentially involving imaging studies like optical coherence tomography (OCT).

### 3. Hypertension (Stage 2)
*   **Reasoning:** The patient's blood pressure reading of 140/90 mmHg falls into the category of Stage 2 Hypertension according to current guidelines. Hypertension is a highly prevalent comorbidity in individuals with type 2 diabetes and significantly contributes to the risk of both microvascular (e.g., diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy) and macrovascular complications (e.g., cardiovascular disease, stroke). Effective blood pressure management is crucial in mitigating these risks.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   Initiate or optimize antihypertensive therapy to achieve target blood pressure goals, typically below 130/80 mmHg for individuals with diabetes.
    *   Encourage lifestyle modifications, including adherence to a low-sodium diet (e.g., DASH diet), regular physical activity, and weight management.
    *   Regular monitoring of blood pressure, both in the clinic and potentially at home.
    *   Screen for target organ damage related to hypertension, such as kidney function (e.g., urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, serum creatinine, eGFR) and cardiac function (e.g., electrocardiogram, echocardiogram).
